    <h1>What is Color Therapy?</h1>
    <p class="pagetext">Color therapy, in laymans terms, is basically where we shine a colorful light at somebody in a comforting room, and that in turn, helps them feel certain emotions, whether that be contempt, energized, or relaxed. This is an easy thing to do, both for the patient, and the staff. We believe color therapy is beneficial to those who are neurodivergent or people whose mental health isn't the best, but it can also be used for people who just need a relaxing experience.</p>

    <h1>Pricing</h1>
    <p class="pagetext">We have experimented with various prices, and we have found the perfect pricing for our therapy sessions. Starting at $30 per individual session, patients will be able to choose between red, green, or blue depending on their needs. You may also purchase a monthly membership which reserves 4 sessions (one every week) This membership costs $75 monthly, but can be canceled any time and can also be scheduled for only one month. </p>
